When using data from a sample of a population of interest
to make inferences about that population,
it's important to be aware of the
sampling process, i.e.
how observed units in the sample were chosen.

The goals of this post are:

1. To briefly introduce probability sampling;
1. To talk about systematic selection biases and how we can reason about it;
1. To expose the risk of being misled by selection bias
when conclusions are driven by common statistical tools;
1. Finally, to demonstrate what you can do about them
and help you to understand the assumptions and consequent
limitations of such tools.

This post is for anyone who is interested on these issues
and has a basic understanding of probability and statistics.

I'll discuss these topics in a simple yet realistic setup.
I'll take advantage of the simplicity to make a deeper analysis
that's hopefully useful in understanding the technique as
applied in the wild.

## The problem

We are interested in a finite population, or universe,
$$U = \{1,2,\ldots,N\}$$ of $$N$$ elements, or units,
and only a sample
$$S \subset U$$ of $$n$$ elements taken from $$U$$ is available.
We want to use $$S$$ to provide a guess, or estimate,
for the populational quantity, or parameter,

$$\begin{equation}
P(C) = \frac{N(C)}{N},
\end{equation}$$

the proportion of elements of $$U$$ that belong to a set $$C \subset U$$.
We write $$N(X)$$ and $$n(X)$$ for the number of elements
of $$X$$ in $$U$$ and $$S$$, respectively.
You can also think of $$P(C)$$ as the probability of
sampling a random element from $$U$$ and then finding out
that it belongs to $$C$$.
These two interpretations
(the "share of something" in the population and
the "probability of something" being sampled)
can be invoked interchangeably
througout the text whenever you see $$P(\text{something})$$.
Also, recall the definition of conditional distributions:

$$
P(X \mid Y) = \frac{P(X \cap Y)}{P(Y)},
$$

where $$X$$ and $$Y \neq \emptyset$$ are subsets of $$U$$.

## The population in one figure

That situation can be visualized below,
where the whole rectangle is $$U$$ and
we also add that it can be partitioned into
two disjoint sets $$A$$ and $$B = A^c$$
(just the complement of $$A$$ in $$U$$),
which are going to be useful in a minute.

You can think of $$A$$ as being any other
characteristic of the elements of $$U$$
that may be important to understand those
which belong to $$C$$.
Both $$A$$ and $$C$$ could be
some thresholding on age, years
of education or gender in case
we are talking about humans.

## Probability sampling

We say that $$S$$ is a probability sample if
it was obtained by a **controlled (i.e. known) randomization procedure**
that attaches to each element $$i \in U$$ an inclusion probability
$$\pi_i$$ of it being chosen to be part of $$S$$.

For a set $$X \subset U$$, we define the binary variable
$$X_i$$ as being 1 when $$i \in X$$ and 0 otherwise.

Note that $$C_i$$ is just a constant
that can be perfectly known as long as we have access
to the unit $$i$$.
On the other hand, we only get to know the
$$S_i$$ values once we get $$S$$,
and repeating the same randomized sampling process
may yield different values for the same $$i$$.
If the sampling procedure itself is known,
then what we know a priori is the inclusion probability
$$P(S_i = 1) = 1 - P(S_i = 0) = \pi_i$$.
That is, prior to sampling, $$S_i$$ is a
[Bernoulli random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution).

Now we may write

$$
P(C)
= \frac{N(C)}{N}
= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i \in U} C_i.
$$

Let's try to employ the sample analogue of the above equation
to estimate $$P(C)$$ from $$S$$
(just because it is pretty intuitive):

$$
\widehat{P(C)}
= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \in S} C_i.
$$

Note that $$\widehat{P(C)}$$ is a random variable
because it depends on $$S$$,
which prior to sampling we do not know.
Let's make the dependence on the random process explicit
in terms of the $$S_i$$ variables
(note the change from $$S$$ to $$U$$ in the second summation):

$$
\widehat{P(C)}
= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \in S} C_i
= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \in U} C_i \cdot S_i.
$$

Is this an accurate estimator of $$P(C)$$?
Since the $$C_i$$s are constants, it's easy to
compute the expectation of this random variable:

$$\begin{align}
\mathrm{E} \left\{ \widehat{P(C)} \right\}
&= \mathrm{E} \left\{ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \in U} C_i \cdot S_i \right\} \\
&= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \in U} C_i \cdot \mathrm{E} \left\{ S_i \right\} \\
&= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \in U} C_i \cdot \pi_i.
\end{align}$$

When all units $$i$$ are equally likely to be sampled,
we have that $$\pi_i = n/N$$ for all $$i$$.
In this case, $$S$$ is called a **simple random sample (SRS)**
and the equation collapses into

$$\begin{align}
\mathrm{E} \left\{ \widehat{P(C)} \right\} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i \in U} C_i = P(C).
\end{align}$$

That is, under a SRS,
the sample proportion of cases in $$C$$ is a nice
guess of its populational counterpart.
When an equation like this holds true, we
say that the estimator is centered for the parameter.

## The Horvitz-Thompson estimator

But what if $$S$$ is not a SRS?
What if the elements in $$U$$ are not equally likely to be in $$S$$?

An important observation is that both
$$P(C)$$ and $$\widehat{P(C)}$$ are linear
combinations of the $$C_i$$s.
Let's write it down:

$$
\widehat{P(C)} = \sum_{i \in S} k_i \cdot C_i,
$$

where the $$k_i$$s are constants.
In the SRS case,
we just saw that $$k_i = 1/n$$ is a
good choice because $$\pi_i = n/N$$.
In general, we observe that the expectation
of this linear estimator is

$$\begin{align}
\mathrm{E} \left\{ \widehat{P(C)} \right\}
&= \mathrm{E} \left\{ \sum_{i \in U} k_i \cdot C_i \cdot S_i \right\} \\
&= \sum_{i \in U} k_i \cdot C_i \cdot \pi_i.
\end{align}$$

If we set $$k_i = (N \pi_i)^{-1}$$,
then $$\widehat{P(C)}$$ is centered for $$P(C)$$.
This is known as the
[Horvitz-Thompson estimator (HTE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horvitz%E2%80%93Thompson_estimator#Proof_of_Horvitz-Thompson_Unbiased_Estimation_of_the_Mean).
It assumes that we know the randomization process
that yields $$S$$ and therefore know the inclusion probabilities
$$\pi_i$$ up to reasonable accuracy for all $$i$$.

Notice that
probability sampling designs may have
different inclusion probabilities for different units
in the population
([SRS is not the only probability sampling design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)#Sampling_methods)).
That is simply a design choice that is commonly employed as a
tool to improve the precision of the estimates under certain circumstances.

But what if we do not know the $$\pi_i$$s?
Equivalently,
**what if we do not know the process that yields $$S$$?**
Well, welcome to most real-world data analysis problems.

## Calibration

In practice, we rarely know the structure of
the sampling process.
However, when we do know it, we saw that
the HTE proposes to weight the data
from unit $$i$$ with $$(N\pi_i)^{-1}$$
and this choice produces a centered estimator.
That's nicely intuitive since we may interpret $$\pi_i^{-1}$$ as
the number of units in $$U$$ that the unit $$i$$
will be responsible to represent in case it's sampled.

The baseline approach is usually the sample proportion,
which we know to be our best guess of $$P(C)$$
under SRS.
How can we improve it?

Let's suppose that knowing that an unit belongs to $$A$$
is a relevant piece of information to guess whether
or not it is also in $$C$$.
In other words,  $$A$$ and $$C$$ are correlated
and then the distribution $$P(C \mid A)$$ is different
from $$P(C)$$.
We'll denote this hypothesis by $$\mathcal{H}$$.

From the
[law of total probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability),
we have

$$\begin{align}
P(C) = P(C \mid A) \ P(A) + P(C \mid B) \ P(B).
\end{align}$$

A similar equation is also true when we condition on the sample as well:

$$
\begin{align}
P(C \mid S)
&= P(C \mid A \cap S)\ P(A \mid S) + P(C \mid B \cap S) \ P(B \mid S).
\end{align}
$$

It may be useful to visualize these equations in the figure at the beginning.
Note that $$P(C \mid S)$$ is just the baseline estimate,
the fraction of $$C$$ in $$S$$ once $$S$$ is realized.
Also, it's informative to evaluate
this last equation for the SRS case,
just to convince ourselves that it makes sense:

$$
\widehat{P_{\text{SRS}}(C)} =
\frac{n(C \cap A)}{n(A)} \frac{n(A)}{n} +
\frac{n(C \cap B)}{n(B)} \frac{n(B)}{n} =
\frac{n(C)}{n},
$$

which is right! We've used the fact that $$A$$ and $$B$$
form a partition of $$U$$
and we removed the conditioning
on $$S$$ and now we have a random variable.

What I want to point out now is how we may improve
this estimator induced by $$P(C \mid S)$$ given that we
do not know the structure of the sampling process but
$$\mathcal{H}$$ is true and we have access to
auxiliary information on $$P(A)$$ in the form
of an alternative estimate $$\widehat{P(A)}$$.

The (observed) bias of our baseline estimator
is $$P(C \mid S) - P(C)$$.
Hopefully, it's clear that it has two sources:

1. $$P(A \mid S) \neq P(A)$$:
Under $$\mathcal{H}$$,
over- or under-representation of $$A$$ in $$S$$
can be a problem since we want to estimate $$P(C)$$;
2. $$P(C \mid A \cap S) \neq P(C \mid A)$$ (similarly for $$B$$):
Even when the previous point is OK, we can still suffer if there is
selection bias within $$A$$ and $$B$$ with respect to $$C$$.

It's a good exercise to verify that both inequalities above
turn into equalities under SRS.
It's also important to notice that these can cause problems
*when we use the baseline fraction-of-$$C$$-in-$$S$$ estimator*
and these issues are present.
In general, these conditions can be met by probability sampling designs and
that would not be a problem because we would be aware of it
and could employ, say, the HTE.
We want to analyze the disparities between a naive
guess and possible underlying populational realities.

The idea is simply to substitute $$P(A \mid S)$$ by
the auxiliary estimate $$\widehat{P(A)}$$,
with $$\widehat{P(B)} = 1 - \widehat{P(A)}$$,
to obtain

$$
\begin{align}
\widehat{P_\text{calib}(C)}
&= \widehat{P(A)} \frac{n(C \cap A)}{n(A)} +
   \widehat{P(B)} \frac{n(C \cap B)}{n(B)} \\
&= \sum_{i \in S} \left(
   \frac{\widehat{P(A)} \cdot A_i \cdot C_i}{n(A)} +
   \frac{\widehat{P(B)} \cdot B_i \cdot C_i}{n(B)}
\right).
\end{align}
$$

This technique is known as **calibration**.
As discussed, it's expected to work as fine as
the sample approximations of the conditional
distributions $$P(C \mid A)$$ and $$P(C \mid B)$$.

This estimator is also linear in $$C_i$$
and the HTE coefficient $$k_i = (N\pi_i)^{-1}$$
is being *estimated* as
$$\widehat{P(A)}/{n(A)}$$ if $$i \in A$$,
and $$\widehat{P(B)}/{n(B)}$$ otherwise.
Also, whenever $$\widehat{P(A)}$$ is a good approximation,
i.e. $$\widehat{P(A)} \approx P(A) = N(A)/N$$,
we get

$$
\frac{\widehat{P(A)}}{n(A)} = \left( N \cdot \frac{n(A)}{N(A)} \right)^{-1},
$$

and thus we are estimating the inclusion probability
$$\pi_i$$ as the probability $$n(A)/N(A)$$ that
a random unit from $$A$$ will be found to be in $$S$$
(take a second to think about it).

That's how our assumptions plus this calibration thing
are effectively modeling the sampling process.

It seems reasonable to argue that
if we have no prior information on the $$\pi_i$$s,
our expectation on the statistical performance of
$$\widehat{P_\text{calib}(C)}$$ is always equal to or better than
that of $$\widehat{P_\text{SRS}(C)}$$
whenever $$\widehat{P(A)}$$ is more accurate than $$n(A)/n$$.

## Sum up

We've learned that

- Under SRS, the commonly used
sample proportion is a good guess for the populational proportion
- When that is not the case but we know the sampling process,
the general form of the proportion estimator is given by
the Horvitz-Thompson estimator, in which each unit $$i$$
is assigned a weight proportional to $$\pi_i^{-1}$$;
- When we do not know the sampling process but we have access
to information on auxiliary variables that correlate with
the variable we want to understand, we can use this extra info
to calibrate our naive sample proportion and expect its
performance to improve a bit, depending on how strong is
that correlation.

In a future post, I hope to show the technique in action with real data.

Thanks for reading.
