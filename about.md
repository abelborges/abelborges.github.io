Welcome! Iâ€™m Abel. I like to think I'm a data inquirer.

This is a personal collection of amusements
and thoughts on statistics and data science.

Exploring the limits of what can be
known from available data and
providing means for people to reliably
act on it is what motivates me.

I currently work on these issues at
[In Loco](https://inloco.com.br).

Feel free to contact me using the links
at the bottom.
