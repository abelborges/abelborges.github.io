Welcome! Iâ€™m Abel.

This is a personal collection of thoughts on data analysis.

Exploring the limits of what can be known from data
and providing means for people to reliably act on it
is the kind of work I'm interested in.

I currently work on these issues at Nubank.

Feel free to contact me using the links at the bottom.
